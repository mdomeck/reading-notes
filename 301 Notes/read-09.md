# Refactoring

## Pure Function
- return the same result if given the same arguments without determinable side effects by passing the value as a parameter in the function
- Pure functions are stable, consistent and predictable

## High-order Functions
- take one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result
- Filter, map are examples 

## Refactoring Code
- starting early in the development process to simplify and refactor code.
