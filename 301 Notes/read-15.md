# Diversity and Inclusion
- Gender gap in tech fields with a small percentage of women in the field
- Thought to be that tech was initially marketed to boys
- Women tend to leave the field and find the environment hard to break into

- Employee breakdown shows some recent promise that things are slowly changing and more women are in the field now than before

- diversity focus comes from the top.
- diverse people bring different ways of seeing a problem and thus faster/better ways of solving it
- know to have positive financial outcomes for the company
