# The Call Stack
- we start with an empty Call Stack. When we invoke a function it automatically add the call stack. once the function has executed all of its code it is automatcally removed. The call stack is empty again.
- uses last in first out principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation
- can only do one thing at a time
- code execution is synchronous
- function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory
Last In, First Out data structure

# Error messages & debugging
- reference errors, syntax errors, range errors, type errors, 
- Being able to read error messages and practising debugging is one of your biggest weapons has a developer.
- before a commit/push, remove all the debugging stuff from your code
