# Domain Modeling
- Process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem.
- When modeling a single entity that will have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model  its attributes with a constructor function that defines ans initializes properties
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Creat instances using the `new` keyword followed by a call to a constructor function
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside
-Use the `this` variale within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside

# Tables Ch 6 126-145
- The `<table>` element is used to add tables to a web page.
- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the `<tr>` element
- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the `<td>` element or `<th>` if it is a header
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes
- Gor long tables you can split the table into a 1`<thread>`. `<tbody>` and `<tfoot>`

# Functions, Methods and Objects Ch 3 106-144
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task
- Functions can take parameters and may retun a value
- An boject is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you
- In an object, variable are know as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window
- JavaScript also has several built in objects such as *String , Number, Math, Date*. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets
