# Local Storage
- We want a lot of storage space on the client that persists beyond a page refresh and is not transmitted to a server
- HTML5 storage- Web Storage
- Local storage or DOM storage
- HTML5 storage is based on named key value pairs. You store data based on a named key then you can retrieve that data
- The named key value is a string
- parseInt() or parseFloat() to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JS database.
