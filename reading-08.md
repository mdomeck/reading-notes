## SOLID principles intro
- S - Single-responsibility principle
  - S.R.P. for short
  - A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job
- O - Open-closed principle
  - Objects or entities should be open for extention but closed for modification
  - a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself
- L - Liskov substitution principle
  - Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of v of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T
  - every subclass/derived class should be substitutable for their base/parent class
- I - Interface segregation principle
  - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use
- D - Dependency Inversion Principle
  - Entities must depend on abstrations not on concretions. The high level module must not depend on the low level module but they should depend on abstractions

## OO SOLID principles in real life
- S ex. Duckboats
- O ex. extention
- L ex. eating stew that is edible
- I ex. changing menu
- D ix. creditcard
