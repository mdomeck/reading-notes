## A Guide to Java Loops
- Types of loops
1. for: repeat certain operation by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter

  for (initialization; Boolean-expression; step) 
  statement;
  Let's see it in a simple example:

  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Simple for loop: i = " + i);
  }

2. for-each
1. While: most fundemental, repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true
1. Do-While: works like While escept the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop
